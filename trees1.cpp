//trees remaining questions
Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes
in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not
necessarily a binary search tree.


//check if both are on same side

4.7 You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds
of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.

//write inorder traversal of both trees if t2 is present in t1 then it is subtree
________________________________________________________________pg 130
4.8 You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm
to print all paths which sum up to that value. Note that it can be any path in the tree
- it does not have to start at the root.
